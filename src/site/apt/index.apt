What is this?

    This library provides functions that perform type arithemtic over the type system
    of Java5. For example, you can compute that <<<List\<String\>>>> is a sub-type of
    <<<Collection\<String\>>>> but not <<<Collection\<Object\>>>>, you can compute
    the erasure of <<<java.lang.reflect.Type>>>, or you can determine the array
    component type <<<T>>> from <<<A\[T\]>>>
